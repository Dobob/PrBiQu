Uploading from gedit text program has caused some spacing and tabbing issues in the code, but shouldn't stop the code from running.

DISCLAIMER:
This is created as a college homework exercise.
The binomial queue and hashtable is based on code taken from Mark Allen Weiss' Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++ textbook. I rewrote and added methods and data, and combined the two programs to create the priority binomial queue.

Weiss' original codes can be found at: http://users.cis.fiu.edu/~weiss/dsaa_c++3/code/


IMPORTANT: This program assumes no duplicates.

			1. Open terminal and type make clean(to delete old object files) just in case.
			2. Type make all.
			3. For probe testing, type: ./testBinomialQueue.exe
			5. Follow the prompts.
